Header/Menu:

The header displays the Dobi logo on the left hand size, which is also a link to index.html/home. The logo is sided by the slogan of the company and a sign up button
on the right side of the line. 
On smaller screens, the sign up button is positioned below the main header on the left.
the menu/navigation bar is shown full width with a pulse effect on the background. On smaller screens, the menu is collapsed to a single button positioned below
the header on the right.
This area is fixed on the top, staying visible all times even when the screen is scrolled.


Index/Home:

This page has a callout banner with a button that would bring the customer to the promotion
under the banner, a section with quotes from customers and what they think of the product. On small resolutions, the text disappears and to read, as per instructions,
