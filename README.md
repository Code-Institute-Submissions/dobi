Dobi Automation Solutions

This project is for a fictional company that offers automation services and products. The website has as main focus to invite new customers and show that the support service is easily accessible.
The website is responsive, changing the layout according to the size of the screen. Some buttons are shown or hidden depending on the screen resolution.


Getting Started

Prerequisites
You can run the deployed website from any computer with internet connection;
No additional software installation is necessary.


Built With
HTML 5 - For Structural Elements
Bootstrap 3.3.7 - For styling
JQuery 3.3.1 - Animations


Header/Menu:

The header displays the Dobi logo on the left hand side, which is also a link to index.html. The logo is sided by the slogan of the company and a sign up button
on the right side of the line. 
On smaller screens, the sign up button is positioned below the main header on the left. The menu/navigation bar is shown full width with a pulse effect on the background of the buttons upon hover. On smaller screens, the menu is collapsed to a single button positioned below the header on the right.
This area is fixed on the top, staying visible all times even when the screen is scrolled.


Index/Home:

This page has a callout banner with a button that would bring the customer to the promotion. Bellow the banner, a section with quotes from customers and what they think of the product. On small resolutions, the text disappears and to read the quotes, as per instructions, the user has to tap the images and the text comes up on modals.


Products:

This page shows the support plans, prices and specificities of each one. Each product is presented by a card with a picture, description of the product and
a button to add to cart. The layout changes depending on the resolution of the screen where, in this case, the "add to cart" button goes to the bottom and the picture+ description take the upper part of the card.
We plan to have the "add to cart" feature fully implemented in the near future.


Services:

Page with services offered. The first item is an embedded demo video, followed by a form for the user to ask for a quote and at the very bottom, the support plans again as an extra place to push sales.


Support: 

Page headed by the FAQ section using an acordeon feature to hide/show the answers for the questions followed by a dismissible alert message encouraging the user to contact us if they haven't their qustion answered. The next item is a form for further questions.
Live-chat is one of the features possible to be implemented to this section. Possibly with automated quick questionaire to narrow down the issue before it gets to the support agent.


About Us:

Page showing the main goals for the company, our ethos and a brief text about the founder of the company.


Sign In:
Button that opens a modal where the user can use the form to input the user details. Always visible for easy recognition and access.


Footer:

The footer is fixed at the bottom of the screen. It contains a brief description of the companys mission and links for the user to follow the
company on social media. The icons are glyphicons with a "fade" animation on hover.
