# Dobi - Automation Solutions

All the sections and functionalities are easily accessible from the navigation bar and most of them won't take more than 3 clicks/taps from the home page to the end of the process. 

## UX

This project is for a fictional company that offers automation services and products for house and business. The main products are the service packages and secondarily automation hardware kits and individual products such as cameras, sensors and more.

As the products offered, the website orbitates the practicality and functionality of things and all features are intended to be easily accessible, intuitive and visible for the user. The design is responsive, changing the layout according to the size of the screen. Some buttons are shown or hidden depending on the screen resolution to make sure the user has the main actions always available on screen.

-Four main User Stories were used to structure the website:
1 - I want to buy the product
2 - I want to sign up for the service
3 - I need support
4 - I need to know more about this before I buy
for these stories we considered both tech savvy and the average internet user that have an interest in automation but aren't sure of what they need.

## Technologies Used

- Mockflow - https://mockflow.com/ - Used to create initial wireframe for the structure.
- HTML 5 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5 - HTML 5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language and it is  the standard programming language across the internet for structure and content.
- CSS 3 - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/ - CSS 3 makes possible to implement responsiveness and style to the HTML document.
- Font Awesome - https://origin.fontawesome.com/ - It allows the introduction of icons that behave as normal text and are hardwired to users mind across the internet making it more recognizable and requiring minimal effort in understanding.
- Hover Library - http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/ - Allows the utilization of pre-made hover effects, accelerating the development and styling process.
- Google Fonts - https://fonts.google.com/ - Offers a wide variety of font styles.
- JQuery 3 - https://jquery.com/ - Allowed the creation of animations such as the collapsed button.


## Testing

During development process, the main tool for tests was the Developer Tools from Google Chrome. 
The website was deployed on GitHub and tested on different screen resolutions and manufacturers (mobile phones).
The link was shared through whatsapp and facebook and we asked the users to fill a form with their feedback from January 28th to February 4th. 

We asked the users doing the test to fulfill the four tasks from our User Stories and their feedback was given through the form.

The website was also tested through Google Chrome Developer tools - Audits for performance, Progressive web app, best practices, accessibility and SEO, with a simulated fast 3g connection and 4x CPU slowdown.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.


For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
