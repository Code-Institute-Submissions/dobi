# Dobi - Automation Solutions

All the sections and functionalities are easily accessible from the navigation bar and most of them won't take more than 3 clicks/taps from the home page to the end of the process. 

## UX

This project is for a fictional company that offers automation services and products for house and business. The main products are the service packages and secondarily automation hardware kits and individual products such as cameras, sensors and more.

As the products offered, the website orbitates the practicality and functionality of things and all features are intended to be easily accessible, intuitive and visible for the user. The design is responsive, changing the layout according to the size of the screen. Some buttons are shown or hidden depending on the screen resolution to make sure the user has the main actions always available on screen.

-Four main User Stories were used to structure the website:
1. I want a quote so I can decide if it's worth it.
2. I want to know where I can use automation and to know more how it works.
3. I need support so I have my problem sorted.
4. I need to find out more about this company. Is it trustworthy?

for these stories we considered both tech savvy and the average internet user that have an interest in automation but aren't sure of what they need.

## Technologies Used

- [Mockflow](https://mockflow.com/) - Used to create initial wireframe for the structure.
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - HTML 5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language and it is  the standard programming language across the internet for structure and content.
- [CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - CSS 3 makes possible to implement responsiveness and style to the HTML document.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Allowed the creation of animations and effects for menus and other features.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Allowed the creation of animations such as the collapsed button.
- [Font Awesome](https://origin.fontawesome.com/) - It allows the introduction of icons that behave as normal text and are hardwired to users mind across the internet making it more recognizable and requiring minimal effort in understanding.
- [Hover Library](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) - Allows the utilization of pre-made hover effects, accelerating the development and styling process.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Offers a wide variety of font styles.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org) - HTML Validator that shows changes necessary for the HTML code to match required standards.


## Testing

During development process, the main tool for tests was the Developer Tools from Google Chrome. 
The website was deployed on GitHub and tested on different screen resolutions and manufacturers (mobile phones).
The link was shared through slack, whatsapp and facebook and we collected users feedback to re-evaluate our project and find ways to improve it from the user point of view. 

We asked the users doing the test to fulfill the four tasks from our User Stories and we asked for their feedback for these specific stories. The results were productive, offering important insights from the users perspective and also reinforcing positive aspects of the project.

The website was also tested through Google Chrome Developer tools - Audits for performance, Progressive web app, best practices, accessibility and SEO, with a simulated fast 3g connection and 4x CPU slowdown.
Some aspects weren't tackled due to our present technical limitations.

Many of the tests were made manually. Using browser "forward and back" arrows for navigating the website, testing the input fields with different formats of data such as email formats and required fields not to be allowed for submition as blank.
We also tested the user stories as test path to ensure they work as desired.

After the tests, we are satisfied with the way the website works on different devices and browsers.

The accessibility features on the code are still a part that we aren't very confident that is implemented correctly but is one of the main priorities on the improvements list as people who have sensorial impairments would be an important part of the potential customer base for the company. 

## Deployment

The project deployment was made using GitHub. 
1. Created the cloud9 environment and files.
2. Created the equivalent repository on GitHub. 
3. Pushed the files from cloud9 to the GitHub repository.
4. On GitHub environment, under the tab "Settings", "github Pages" section, I selected "master branch" and saved.
5. After a few seconds the page was published.

From this point, all the changes on the pages were made straight from Cloud9 as I pushed the content.

If you wish to run the code locally, it is possible once you have saved the files for the page you wish to run (html, css, images and/or videos).
1. Make sure you have a browser installed on your computer.
2. Find the saved files
3. Right-click (Windows/Linux) or two-finger-click (Mac) on the file and select "Open with" from the action menu.

### Acknowledgements

- Special thanks to Simen Daehlin, my mentor and resposible for turning this project 180ยบ. Thank you for pushing and not holding back on what needed to be done to be among the best.

- I got inspiration from  [Apple](www.apple.com), [MEO Smart Home](https://www.meo.pt) and [SB ITAV](https://www.stevenbrennanit.com/smarthome)  and used these websites as visual and content references and to help me deciding what to include or leave out of my project. I used my experience as user on their website to try to find out which features were attractive and useful for me as a user and potential customer and ultimately bring these conclusions as building blocks for my project.
